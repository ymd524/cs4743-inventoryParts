Implementation:
Zach - Implemented a multi-list listener in a single view. Probably spent way too much time on that. But got it to work.

Assignment 4:
Zach - I fixed some of the issues that I had in Assignment 3, still having trouble with refreshing the views in the 
inventory views. I will continue working on this on the next assignment. I did not add optimistic locking to add inventory item,
because of the way we have adding an inventory item it really wouldn't make sense. But optimistic locking is implemented in 
editing inventory items.
